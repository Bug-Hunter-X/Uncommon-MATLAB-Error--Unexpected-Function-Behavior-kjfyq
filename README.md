This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon error in MATLAB related to unexpected behavior within a function.  The `bug.m` file contains a function `myFunction` that may produce unexpected results or throw an error depending on the input. The `bugSolution.m` file demonstrates the corrected implementation with proper error handling.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in MATLAB functions to prevent unexpected program termination and ensure reliable code execution.
